# Music Library Relational Database (CS50 SQL Final Project)

This repository contains my final project for **CS50’s Introduction to Databases with SQL (Harvard University)**.

The project demonstrates the design and implementation of a **relational SQLite database** for organizing music data, including artists, albums, songs, platforms, and ratings. It includes a fully defined schema and example SQL queries used to explore and analyze the data.
